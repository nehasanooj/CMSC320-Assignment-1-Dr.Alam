Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science can be applied to the field of health care. Data science can look at the trends of some diseases and predict when cases are to rise. For example, data science has helped us learn that flu cases rise in fall/winter seasons. That is why we get the flu shot during the early fall.
